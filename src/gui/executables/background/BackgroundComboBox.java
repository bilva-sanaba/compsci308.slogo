// This entire file is part of my masterpiece.
// Bilva Sanaba
// This class implements the BackgroundChooser as a comboBox and gives it properties so that it executes a command
//     whenever the comboBox is interacted with, and also labels the node combobox
// It highlights good design as all implementations of the backgroundchooser which use a combobox would need this code
//     so by pushing it to a super class, duplicate code is reduced and extendability is more possible with less code
// It also reduces duplicate code by creating a combobox using the buttonmaker class which uses the factory design pattern
