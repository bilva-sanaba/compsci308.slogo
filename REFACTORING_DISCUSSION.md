#Refactoring Discussion
##Slogo Team 13
###Bilva Sanaba, Alex Blumenstock, Jacob Weiss, Dhruv Patel
###As a group we discussed how we would communicate between front end and back end as we added methods to change front end display, as well as incorporate the multiple turtles. 

####We decided that it would be best for the front end display to be determined by the backend in that only the backend commands can change the frontend displays. While this creates a dependency between the two in that all frontend updates (ie background color) can only come from a backend command, there is still way the backend accesses the display of colors. 

##### We did not have time to in-depthly write all our changes, but we did work on moving most major classes into smaller commands as well as creating abstract classes as we did this. Additionally we worked as a full group as we felt it was most important for us to use our little time together to discuss communication design between the two parts.
