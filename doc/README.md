Contributers: Alex Blumenstock, Bilva Sanaba, Dhruv K. Patel, Jacob Weiss

We started working on our plan February 16 and concluded this project on March 10th.  We estimate that we each spent an average 25 hours each week on this project.

Alex and Bilva handled the front-end while Jacob and Dhruv worked on the back-end.  Within each end, there was a lot of cooperation and team-coding, so it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly the responsibilities of each member.  Jacob did more work with the interpreter and parser while Dhruv did more work with the commands and trajectories, although each worked a lot on all parts.  Alex worked with css, xml, and auxillary features while Bilva took the lead on the turtle drawing and animation, although again, both worked extensively on all parts of the front-end.

We used the code/concepts given to us in class and the java documentation to complete this project.  We also used StackOverflow for more specific issues, and some code from past projects (ie: cellsociety). 

In the default package, the Main class launches this project.

The provided example files were used to test the project.

The project requires language-based .properties files containing the translation of allowed commands.  It also requires an XML file containing the default background color, list of allowed turtle shapes, and default language.  An option css file can be used to configure the panels.  Finally, a .properties file gives the default colors in the palette.

The program is very straightforward.   Using the help button. valid commands and formats can be found.  Very self explanatory button names explain each of their functionalities.  Clicking a turtle toggles its selection, and using the "WASD" keys it can be moved. (W=forward, S=backwards, A=left, D=right).  

Known bugs:  At high animation delay, the animation feature can result in extraneous lines when multiple commands are rapidly entered.  At extremely low delay, the animation feature may fail to draw lines.
Comboboxes don't always update when values are changed using backend commands.
The turtle image and pencolor cannot be changed with the very first command


Extra Features: 
TextInput for background color

The assignment was very good.  We learned a lot about team coding and the usefulness of many design patterns.
