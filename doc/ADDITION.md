##Estimation:
I think that this extension will take me about an hour.  
I think that I will have to change the InputPanel class to give it an ImageChangeBox, which contains the display of the turtles and is clickable to toggle their images.  I will also have to write the ImageChangeBox class, and probably an ImageListCell to serve as its cell factory.
